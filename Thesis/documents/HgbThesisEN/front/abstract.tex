\chapter{Abstract}

Due to technological advances in both Hardware and Software-Integration, Augmented Reality is getting more popular with each year. 
\\
One of the issues still prevalent in Augmented Reality Software is the distraction caused by clutter surrounding the digital content in use cases like immersive analytics.  
\\\\
This bachelors thesis focuses on the analysis of the different methods and algorithms for the concealment of the clutter to provide a clean and non-distracting environment for the digital object to be displayed on. 
\\
To accomplish this, a tool to select planes on which objects are detected to subsequently be hidden through inpainting will be implemented. With this tool, several methods and algorithms will be evaluated in terms of both quality and performance to provide believable and uncluttered environments, whilst at the same time minimizing the use of computational resources and time.
\\ 
These findings are compared to each other so readers can get an overview on both the advantages and disadvantages each of the analyzed approaches delivers.
